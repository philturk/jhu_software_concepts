dependencies is given in the file *requirements.txt*.

2025_05_25: Warning -- you might encounter a rendering error trying to open *Snapshots.pdf* within GitHub. This is is a known limitation of how GitHub renders PDF files in the browser. However, the file is still hosted properly. Please download the file and open it locally instead of attempting to preview it in GitHub.
