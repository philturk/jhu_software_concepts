One of my referees wasn't able to get their reference letter in on time, and they still accepted my application with just 2 references. If you're applying to U of A for SLP my best advice is to job shadow as many SLPs as you can, try gaining work experience in related fields, and focus on your letter of interest and reference letters.

After May 1, thinking maybe I was on the wait list and they were waiting to see if a space opened up after others replied to offers, I finally contacted graduate admissions, who said the department had not yet notified them to send my decision, and they suggested I contact someone else in the Creative Writing department, which I did. Here was the response: 
""I'm sorry you have not received word from the Graduate School yet. Notices should have been sent out a month ago. Perhaps we have the wrong email address for you on file.

The offers of admission have been sent out and so have the rejections. You should check your application portal to confirm whether you have received either of these notifications. If you did not receive either notification, then you were on our waitlist, and we were hoping to be able to admit you. 

However, at this point, we have made all the offers we expect to make for the Fall 2025 semester. Due to the statewide hiring freeze by the governor of Louisiana, we will not be making any offers after April 12. The earliest we may resume the process is in July, barring any extensions of the hiring freeze. 

I’ve accepted an offer at another school anyways but just wanted my answer. Best of luck to anyone else who is on the waitlist (?? at least I think I’m on the waitlist)

Although you were among our top candidates, we do not have enough positions available to offer you admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. 

Graduate education is characterized by small classes and close mentoring by faculty. As a result, programs have only a limited number of available seats. Our decisions about who to admit are not made solely on the basis of the excellence of our applicants, but also with a consideration of whose work we can best support. Each year we receive many more applications than can be accommodated; consequently, we are unable to admit many highly qualified students.

We are unable to share where you are on the waitlist.

There is no set number of rounds for additional offers. 

Applicants on the waitlist will be notified of an updated decision after the first-round response deadline (April 15), after we see how many spaces are still available in the program.

The next round of offers will likely be closer to the end of April.

Admission is determined by the quantity and quality of applications received each year. With the increase in applications received, this year was exceptionally competitive.

Dear XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:

On behalf of Dean Lynne Kiorpes and the Graduate School of Arts and Science, I am very pleased to tell you that you have been admitted to the Master of Arts program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. You may register for the Fall 2025 semester.

We appreciate your application to the Department of Anthropology. While the Department of Anthropology was not able to offer you admission, we very much hope you would consider pursuing a master's in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS). After a special review of applications, yours was selected by CLACS due to your research interests and profile. We feel that you may be interested in the interdisciplinary master's program in the Center. An MA from CLACS is your next step in furthering a career related to Latin America or the Caribbean, and CLACS alumni have gone on to doctoral programs at NYU, Duke, Princeton, Yale, USC, and UT Austin, among a number of others. Our location in New York City, furthermore, gives you access to one of the most exciting and intellectually stimulating cities in the world.

We regret to add that there are no fellowships or scholarships available to you through the Graduate School or your program. In the Other Resources section of the Admitted Student Resource Page (see link below), you will find information detailing other sources of funding. I encourage you to explore the many options available.","2025-03-29","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/982870","Rejected on 27 Mar","Fall 2025","American",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"PhD"

However, the lack of communication throughout the process left a negative impression. It also seemed they were interested in admitting me but couldn't proceed due to funding issues this year.

Notes:
Received admission offer for the Master of Development Engineering program at UC Berkeley. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity, as UC Berkeley is my top choice due to its exceptional faculty, community, and research initiatives.

Currently seeking financial assistance options due to personal financial constraints—coming from Kazakhstan, a single-parent family with annual income below $25,000. Previously secured a full-ride financial aid package from Georgetown University for undergraduate studies, significantly easing family financial pressures.

Other competing offers included generous financial assistance from Columbia University, London School of Economics (LSE), Georgetown, and Copenhagen Business School. Despite these, I strongly prefer UC Berkeley and am willing to make significant commitments and sacrifices to attend.

Actively pursuing internal opportunities for Teaching or Research Assistantships at UC Berkeley, specifically interested in engaging with professors such as Dr. David Zilberman, Dr. Marco Gonzalez-Navarro, and Dr. Shankar Sastry, as well as research initiatives associated with Blum Center for Developing Economies, Big Ideas Contest, Engineers Without Borders, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Also exploring external funding (Fulbright), and considering educational loans (MPOWER) with a responsible repayment plan in place.

5012,"University of California (UCSC), Anthropology","IGNORE STATUS, just received the following email from the director of UCSC’s program, and really unsure how to feel about this clearly automated email, when all other UC’s have already sent their decisions. FEELS LIKE A SCAM FLR SURE - MOST EXPENSIVE APPLICATION FEE AND I CHECKED WITH PROFESSORS IF THEY HAD FUNDING BEFORE APPLYING, and they ENCOURAGED me to apply. WTF. For future applicants, avoid this school and profrssors in their anthropology department. Liars. And waste of 100 something dollars. Thank fck I’ve got other offers, but feel so bad for people banking on UCSC’s decision. 

Here is the BS EMAIL:
“I am writing to offer sincere thanks for your application to the Anthropology Ph.D. program at UC Santa Cruz, and to express appreciation for your patience during an unprecedented admissions season.  

This admissions cycle began with our typical (somewhat lengthy) multi-stage review process. As mentioned in my last email, in order to give every application the thorough assessment it deserved, close readings were done by faculty members, which were then discussed with sub-field colleagues, who subsequently shared their impressions with our entire admissions committee.  As Chair of the Anthropology Admissions Committee I always find it exciting to learn about the accomplishments and academic goals of our applicants!

However, very late in the cycle, when departments were preparing to submit acceptance nominations to our Graduate Division, admissions deliberations encountered an atypical wrinkle that further lengthened our deliberations. As you are likely aware, uncertainties around the status of Federal grants and contracts for research and education have impacted the admissions postures of many universities. UC Santa Cruz is among the many institutions adjusting to this budgetary uncertainty, and our Graduate Division determined the need to dramatically scale back admissions for fall 2025. 

This will make for an exceptionally lean admissions picture for UCSC Anthropology – perhaps the most competitive in our program’s history.  While the UCSC Graduate Division will be sending official decision letters very soon, I wanted to communicate with you personally, to thank you for the time and care you gave your application, and to provide context for the difficult decisions we had to make this year.

Wishing you the very best as you pursue your academic goals”","2025-03-20","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/981002","Wait listed on 19 Mar","Fall 2025","International",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"PhD"

Each term there are many highly qualified applicants for a limited number of openings in this program and, unfortunately, we are unable to offer you admission to the Graduate School at this time.

Best wishes in your future endeavors and thank you again for your interest in graduate study at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.​"" I was so hopeful about the acceptance. This is my 7th Public Policy school's PhD rejection even after I have a 4.00 Master's CGPA from US university.","2025-03-14","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/979154","Rejected on 14 Mar","Fall 2025","International","3.04",NULL,NULL,NULL,"PhD"

Due to high competition, not all applicants could be invited for an admission interview. After carefully reviewing your application, we found that your expectations may not fully align with the programme’s focus, and other applicants were a closer match. While AI is an important part of AISS curriculum, our programme covers a broader range of topics and does not include dedicated courses in environmental science, climate change prevention, healthcare, or robotics for healthcare.

Additionally, there may have been technical issues with your submission, such as an overly long motivational video or an incomplete portfolio, which could have affected the evaluation process.

We encourage you to explore programmes that align more closely with your future career aspirations. We sincerely appreciate your interest in AISS and wish you the best of luck with your academic and professional journey!

On behalf of the academic department, I am writing in connection with your application for admission to the Doctor of Philosophy in Public Policy. The department has now carefully considered your application and supporting materials, but we are sorry to have to inform you that your application has not been successful.

Application to the University of Oxford is extremely competitive, and we are not able to offer places to all the excellent candidates who apply.

Thank you for having considered graduate study at Oxford. We wish you every success with your plans for future study.

7059,"Columbia University, Physics","Email to check portal. Year three. Three full cycles of rejections. Every single program, every single application—denied. Again.

I graduated two years ago from a T10 university with a B.Sc. in physics and mathematics with a minor in physical chemistry. Eight years of research experience in high-energy theory and experiment—two at a university while still in high school, four during undergrad, and two more post-graduation. I took two semesters of graduate-level coursework as an undergrad. Spent summers in three NSF REU programs, attended a summer school in high-energy theory, and another in experimental particle physics. Completed a year-long senior thesis on top of my ongoing research at my home university. Published multiple papers, five first author. Presented at three undergraduate research symposia, two mixed symposia, and two major conferences.

Three years as a teaching assistant in undergrad. The last year spent as a physics instructor at a community college. Like an 880 on the PGRE.

This cycle, I changed everything. New essays, a reworked CV, three entirely different recommenders, a new fourth recommender. It didn’t matter. The outcome was the same.

I have no idea what else I could have done. No idea what I’m missing. No idea if there was ever a path forward in the first place, or if I was just clinging to the illusion of one.

Physics doesn’t want me. I get it now.

Good luck to everyone else. If you aren't Vishnu himself you evidently aren't good enough for physics.","2025-03-13","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/978908","Rejected on 13 Mar","Fall 2025","American","3.97",NULL,NULL,NULL,"PhD"

7628,"University of Colorado Boulder, Physics","Got this email today. AMO-EX and Boulder is my #1 choice, so if anyone got accepted and not planning on attending, please decline the offer.

I’m sorry I have not sent this email earlier. I wanted to give you an update on your status. You are one of about 50 students who has neither been admitted nor denied admission to the CU Boulder physics Ph.D. program. Last year, we ended up with a very large incoming class of 80 students compared to our target of 60. Last year we admitted 248 students. To compensate for last year and to be conservative given the uncertainty in federal funding, we have admitted only 123 out of 1224 applications. In a normal year, nearly all of you would be admitted to our program. Unfortunately, this is not a normal year. The reason that we have kept your application active is in case it seems that our entering class will be even smaller than our target. If that were to occur, we may be able to admit a handful of you.

In summary, it is very unlikely that you will be admitted to the CU physics Ph.D. program. You should definitely make plans based on not receiving an offer from us. A few of you (out of 50) may end up receiving an offer. We plan to finalize our admissions by April 11.","2025-03-12","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/978329","Wait listed on 12 Mar","Fall 2025","American",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"PhD"

""You are one of about 50 students who has neither been admitted nor denied admission to the CU Boulder physics Ph.D. program.  Last year, we ended up with a very large incoming class of 80 students compared to our target of 60.  Last year we admitted 248 students.  To compensate for last year and to be conservative given the uncertainty in federal funding, we have admitted only 123 out of 1224 applications. In a normal year, nearly all of you would be admitted to our program.  Unfortunately, this is not a normal year.  The reason that we have kept your application active is in case it seems that our entering class will be even smaller than our target.  If that were to occur, we may be able to admit a handful of you.""

In summary, it is very unlikely that you will be admitted to the CU physics Ph.D. program.  You should definitely make plans based on not receiving an offer from us.  A few of you (out of 50) may end up receiving an offer. We plan to finalize our admissions by April 11.","2025-03-12","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/978317","Wait listed on 12 Mar","Fall 2025","American",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"PhD"

8111,"Princeton University, Bioengineering","Thank you for applying to Princeton University’s Graduate School for the 2025-26 academic year. While I assure you that the materials you submitted were carefully reviewed by the faculty in the Department of Bioengineering, I regret to inform you the department did not recommend your admission for the upcoming academic year.

The number of admission offers available at Princeton for entering graduate students is extremely limited, and we cannot offer admission to all applicants who are well qualified. Indeed, many departments have applicants who could be admitted if it were possible to accommodate additional students. Our decisions take into account not only the applicants’ merits but also the suitability of the programs to the candidates’ expressed interests. Our goal is to achieve a sound match between the strengths of our programs and the interests of the relatively small number of outstanding students that can be accommodated.

Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications which we receive, it is not possible for the department or the Graduate School to go back and review applications to justify the denial or offer advice on fortifying a future application.

I wish you success in your plans for graduate study and thank you for considering Princeton University.","2025-03-11","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/977833","Rejected on 11 Mar","Fall 2025","American","3.52",NULL,NULL,NULL,"PhD"

8326,"ETH Zurich, Management, Technology and Economics (MTEC)","MTEC admissions looks for a well-rounded profile. There is no interview but my guess is that they do care much more than other MSc. of ETH about extracurriculars and the motivation letter. I was top 20% with a 2.3 german grade (nothing that crazy) from a good German uni (mech. eng.), but I frankly had very good extracurriculars (lots of debate, social sciences engagement, formula student, small fintech internship and teaching assistant of 4 subjects, 4 languages). In terms of work experience, I tend to think that they look for potential rather than CV, since I know people with 1, 2 or 3 years of experience in consulting/engineering who got rejected. Ask yourself why this is the right program for you (and not a MiM at HEC Paris for example) and be able to explain it in a good motivation letter. Also, I believe that for masters there is hundreds of chinese and indian students who apply to European unis, which maybe plays against them all, because there is really not a way to differentiate between the top unis in Asia (moral of the story: try to get a well rounded profile rather than focusing your time during the bachelor in being top 1 of the class).","2025-03-11","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/977614","Accepted on 10 Mar","Fall 2025","International","3.2",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Masters"

Submitted my application in Nov for Dec 1 deadline though Breana didn’t process my application till Dec 15 even after repetitive emails for Toefl waiver which is needed to be administered by her before Dec 1 or else the application remains incomplete and doesn't get processed. In the meantime I also emailed my POI Tiffany A Koszalka, who gave me typical reply of all faculty evaluating process, no interest was shown. On Jan 28 I emailed Huang & Breana, off which Breana replied immediately noting a decision will be made on 15 feb, just after 4 hours I received a rejection notification. Next day Huang replied saying the application is still under review which made me think about what was the final decision. I escalated the issue to the dean about different emails and after that nobody has replied. I came to know from other students that they only prefer their masters students and external students are only invited to inflate the application numbers. I unnecessarily lost my application fee. The department sends another email once they reject the candidate they send another email telling the candidate to get enrolled in their online masters program for 50% scholarship when the candidate has a masters. There is another review written 2 years which says the same thing, everyone please scroll and read.","2025-03-11","https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/977551","Rejected on 31 Jan","Fall 2025","International","3.25","315",NULL,NULL,"PhD"

For anyone looking for advice, GPA isn't everything! My cumulative was 3.60, but my major was closer to a 3.2. Use your application to explain why you are passionate to be an SLP, and how NU will assist you in following your passions! The app is 4 questions. That's it. Your answers and LORs are everything.

The process of selecting students for the incoming class is one that our admissions committee takes very seriously. We must make very fine distinctions among highly qualified applicants, many of whom could be successful in our program. Given our small size, this often means having to pass on many impressive, accomplished, and interesting candidates.
